# ðŸ§° App-local Key Logger (for Testing & Debugging)

A simple Tkinter-based **local key logger** for testing and debugging purposes.  
This app logs all key presses made inside its own text box â€” not system-wide â€” and saves them to `key_log.txt` with timestamps.

- Displays the last pressed key in the status bar.
- Includes buttons to **clear the log file** and **quit** the app.
